<h1>Learning Engineering</h1>
<time datetime="2019-11-19">November 19, 2019</time>

<p>Learning and gaining skills are essential traits of being a good engineer. The field of engineering is broad and, knowledge of nearly any topic may be represented in engineering. Because of this one must choose a domain of knowledge and gain mastery in this domain. But, with an ever expanding consumer market and advances in realizable technology these domains may lose value and, a new domain of mastery must be gained. This is an opinionated guide to learning engineering.</p>

<h1 id="basic-concepts">Basic Concepts</h1>
<p>We can categorize learning into 2 distinct concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studying materials.</li>
<li>Proof of mastery.</li>
</ul>
<p>Studying materials contain knowledge. They may be books, research papers, lectures, etc. With the wide spread adoption of the internet gathering these materials have become much easier. Web searches often pull up useful information that may be used for studying materials. Suitable studying materials usually come from books and lecture notes made available by a professor at an institution offering a course in your area of interest.</p>
<p>Proof of mastery demonstrates competence of knowledge. They may be graded tests or lab projects. This is often a difficult spot for self-teachers. Graded tests are usually not as helpful as lab projects for engineering. A good lab project should contain an implementation of the concept as well as a report explaining the implementation and observations of the project. This helps ensure pedagogical soundness of the learning.</p>
<h1 id="choosing-outcomes">Choosing Outcomes</h1>
<p>Not all learning is to the same ends. Why people choose to learn something new is subjective. However, learning is usually not an end into itself and is often tied to some institution or some other outcome. So, it is useful to understand and tailor your learning outcomes to these ends.</p>
<p>If you choose to learn for the sake of academia the eventual outcome of this is publishing research that is highly cited. So, demonstrating that you can organize, express and present ideas that build on existing research would be a useful proof of mastery while learning.</p>
<p>If you choose to learn for the sake of capital the eventual outcome of this is launching a product. So, demonstrating that you can execute quickly on ideas would be a useful proof of mastery while learning.</p>
<p>The outcome one chooses when learning should be incorporated into the proof of mastery. In this way, more value is created for the learner and the goal is reached quicker.</p>
<h1 id="going-further">Going Further</h1>
<p>Having domain specific knowledge is useful and necessary but, there exists higher degrees of knowledge and skills. These skills are often abstract and essential underpinnings of the domain specific knowledge. These are usually categorized as theoretical concepts. They give tremendous perspective into field you wish to know, but are usually not realizable in practical settings.</p>
<p>Lisp is a good example of such a concept. It is essential to the whole of computer science. It provides tremendous insight into the field of engineering as an abstract concept but is usually not practical for professional work which builds on engineering done by other individuals and organizations.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Learning is an essential trait of being an engineer. To learn effectively, it is useful to study materials of a domain of knowledge and to demonstrate mastery of this knowledge with the intended outcome in mind.</p>
